Note: Time is estimated using Tranter's Correction for Naismith's Rule using
40min per 0.8km hiked with 300m of elevation as the fitness parameter.

## Planning Constraints
Each primary destination needs to have the following:
1. Enough rest time for driving.
2. More than the essential events planned,
3. A conservative amount of time allocated to each event; and,
4. Some leftover events to be scheduled in case of leftover time.

## Planning Criteria
### Safety
This is achieved mainly through allowing enough rest for drivers.

### Balance between depth of experience and body limits
This gives rise to the constraint that no hike or series of activities shall be
more difficult than the weakest can handle.

### Balance between breadth of experience and trip fatigue
This suggests that ideally, the experience should consist of just a little more
than what would be the most iconic sceneries expected by the travellers. This
would give the travellers a sense of satifaction since every place they had
been to is memorable, and, as they had begun to experience diminishing returns,
that there is not too much to regret.

### Balance between leisure and speed
The goal is to be speedy without frequent worries of timeliness. We need to
have enough time such that,
1. If time at each destination is leisurely spent, it will not affect
the plan; and,
2. If an uncommon disruptive event occurs, the essential events can still be
carried out.

Likely and uncommon sources of tardiness:
- Wanting to spend more time to enjoy the views
- Need of physical rest
- Incidents with hotel bookings
- Possible injury

## Appendix III: Proposed Routes
### Overview
![][prelim]

These numbers are derived from [Proposed Routes](#proposed-routes)

Note: CW's 8, 9, 10 are squeezed into 8 and 9. This is done through moving a
hike from day 9 to day 8, and then squeezing 9 and 10 into 9, and subtracting
an hour of driving from day 10's number.

#### Estimated Daily Hiking and Driving Hours

Day | CW Hiking | CCW Hiking | CW Driving | CCW Driving | CW Total | CCW Total
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
1 | 0 | 5  | 10 | 7  | 10 | 12
2 | 6 | 9  | 6  | 1  | 12 | 10
3 | 4 | 5  | 6  | 5  | 10 | 10
4 | 5 | 8  | 3  | 1  | 8  | 9
5 | 4 | 3  | 5  | 8  | 9  | 11
6 | 5 | 5  | 4  | 3  | 9  | 8
7 | 7 | 4  | 5  | 6  | 12 | 10
8 | 9 | 6  | 1  | 6  | 10 | 12
9 | 5 | 0  | 7  | 10 | 12 | 10
Total | 45 | 45 | 47 | 47 | 92 | 92

Note 1: Hiking numbers assume a leisurely pace  
Note 2: Driving numbers assume ~10% slack, Google Maps estimates 35 hours  
Note 3: Sunrise at 6:10, Sunset at 20:10 -- total 14 hours of sunlight
